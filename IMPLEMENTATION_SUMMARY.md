- Total amount is automatically recalculated
- Original calculated rate is preserved for comparison

### 2. **Final Price Override**

- Daily rate is automatically recalculated
- Shows difference from original calculated amount

### 3. **Audit Trail**

## 🔄 Business Logic

### Override Priority System:
1. **Final Price Override** (highest priority)
   - Uses provided final price
   - Calculates daily rate as: `final_price / total_days`
   - Disables daily rate override

2. **Daily Rate Override** (medium priority)
   - Uses provided daily rate
   - Calculates total amount as: `daily_rate × total_days`
   - Disables final price override

3. **Automatic Calculation** (default)
   - Uses PricingService for sophisticated pricing
   - Applies weekly/monthly discounts based on duration
   - Stores original calculated amount for comparison
